Remote Access Software that is able to transfer files, open a messenger terminal, visualize and control the remote computer.

The 1.0 version was developed in Borland Delphi 6 in 2004 as the final project of World ORT (RJ, Brazil). It still works on modern Windows operation systems.

The code is not avaiable to the public (yet) for security reasons.
